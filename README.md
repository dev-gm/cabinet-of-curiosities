# Cabinet of Curiosities
A offline multiplayer video game I made for my art class to simulate a Cabinet of Curiosities, written in pygame. It includes drawings of many items that have been influencial in my life. You can walk around with WASD or Arrow Keys. To select an item, which is represented by a square on the screen, you press SPACE. This will bring the photo up to the screen.
